# AI Planner (Flutter + Local LLM)

AI Planner is an AI-assisted task management application built with **Flutter**.  
It integrates a **locally running LLM (Qwen via Ollama)** to enhance productivity with intelligent task analysis and automatic tag generation.

> This project is under active development.

## Overview

AI Planner allows users to:

- Create and manage daily tasks  
- Automatically generate contextual tags using a local LLM  
- Receive AI-assisted task planning suggestions  
- Store tasks securely with Firebase  
- Authenticate users with a secure login system  

The application explores how **local large language models (LLMs)** can be integrated into mobile applications for productivity enhancement.
